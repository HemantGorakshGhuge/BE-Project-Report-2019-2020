\section{Conclusion}
\paragraph{}Hence, it concluded that AGVs play a major role in engineering industries for mass production with large area to improve the material handling technique at faster rate, increase efficiency and minimize the transportation costs and time. \\
\newline
We have successfully developed and implemented:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $360^{\circ}$ Manual head control motion
    \item Without PID Line Follow using Camera
    \item Low Voltage Estimation
    \item Side Arm - Two motion from one actuator
    \item Graphical User Interface
    \item QR code scanning
    \item Shortest Path Algorithm
\end{enumerate}

\\Also, COVID-19 pandemic has showed us that more automation in hospital industry is needed.

\section{Future Scope}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Few things that can be added or improved in this project:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item More and more testing
        \item Line following with PID
        \item Integration of  robot and shortest path algorithm with no line reference
        \item Self Charging with LiPo battery
        \item Integration of face recognition and person following – Body tagging using Face
    \end{itemize}
    \item Projects like "google car" are assuring us the next big "auto guided vehicles" coming in automobile sector
    \item ``Audi has recently tested their A7" remotely on self-driving mode till 560 miles
    \item Chevrolet is providing 4G (LTE) connectivity in their vehicles for faster Navigations \& for updating the OS of their infotainment
    \item Volvo is providing ``apple’s IOS" as infotainment for their all 2015 models
\end{itemize}
